## Features
-	Easy to use UI with no terminals and no code required.
-	Runs on Windows and Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon).
-	It’s a free, open-source app.
-	Run Large Language Models (LLMs) like Meta’s Llama 2, Mistral, Yi, Microsoft’s phi 2, OpenAI, zephyr and more all in the same app with a familiar chatbot interface.
-	Quick access to LLMs from Hugging Face right inside the app. You can even see what’s popular or trending.
-	Quickly swap between models mid-conversation for the best results. 
-	Private by design: the LLMs all run on your machine, so you can keep your chats private.
-	Wingman will evaluate your machine so you can see at a glance what models may or may not run on your hardware. We won’t stop you from trying any of them, though!
-	Save and organize your chats into folders so you can find them again later. 
-	Set system prompts and prompt templates so you can talk with characters and get the best results from all models.
