## Features
- Easy to use UI with no terminals and no code required.
- Runs on Windows and Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon).
- It’s a free, open-source app.
- Run models like Llama 2, Mistral, Yi, phi, OpenAI, zephyr and more all in the same app with a familiar chatbot interface.
- Quick access to LLMs from Hugging Face right inside the app. You can even see what’s popular or trending.
- Quickly swap between models mid-conversation for the best results. 
- Private by design: the LLMs all run on your machine, so you can keep your chats private.
- Wingman will evaluate your machine so you can see at a glance what models may or may not run on your hardware. We won’t stop you from trying the best, though!
- Save and organize your chats into folders so you can find them again later. 
- Set system prompts and prompt templates so you can talk with characters and get the best results from all models.
