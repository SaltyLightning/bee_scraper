Not Jesus. He disappeared; no one knows what happened to him. But I'm out there every day protecting churches from crazy liberals.\"While Trump admitted that Jesus did do some things for Christianity in the past, Trump said he was doing more now and it was more substantial. \"I'm appointing judges to help protect religious rights,\" Trump stated. \"How many judges has Jesus appointed? He says something about judging people in the future, but I ain't seen it.\"Furthermore, Trump asserted that he \"saved Christmas.\" \"Look what I've done,\" he said. \"You can say 'Merry Christmas' now. In fact, if you say 'Happy Holidays' and don't immediately make it clear you're referring to Christmas, you go to prison. What has Jesus ever done for Christmas? Be born? He wants credit for that?

You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling.
